# About Dovvvv

👋 Hello! I’m Dov
🌱 Passionate about coding, I specialize in TypeScript, Python, MongoDB, and Vector databases, with a strong focus on RAG-based systems.

💡 Currently, I’m diving into the intersection of AI and Web3, building AI-powered tools at Soul Agents. Proud to have secured 3rd place in the Brian AI Hackathon—check out the trading repo for a glimpse of the action!

🤝 Always open to collaboration—let’s create something amazing together.
